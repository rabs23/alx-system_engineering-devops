The firewalls are for protecting the network from unwanted and unauthorized users by acting as an intermediary between the internal and external network, and blocking the incoming traffic matching the aforementioned criteria.
The purpose of SSL certificate
The SSL certificate is for encrypting the traffic between the web servers and external networks to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and network sniffers from sniffing the traffic which could expose valuable information. The SSL certificates ensure privacy, integrity and identification.
The purpose of the monitoring clients.
The monitoring clients are for monitoring the servers and external network. They analyze the performance and operations of the servers, measure the overall health and alert the administrators if the servers are not performing as expected. The monitoring tool observes the servers and provides key metrics about the serversâ€™ operations to the administrators. It automatically tests the accessibility of the servers, measures response time, and alerts for such errors as corrupt/missing files, security vulnerabilities/violations, and many other issues.

Issues with the Infrastructure
Terminating SSL at the load balancer level would leave the traffic between the load balancer and web servers unencrypted.
Having one MySQL server is an issue because it is not scalable and can act as a single point of failure for the web infrastructure.
Having servers with all the same components would make the components contend for resources on the server like CPU, Memory, I/O, etc., which can lead to poor performance and also make it difficult to locate the source of the problem. A setup such as this is not easily scalable.
